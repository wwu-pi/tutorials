title: Accessing a Web Service from Java
---

<p>In order to conveniently access a Web service, regardless of its implementation language, a Java application can use proxy classes which offer a type-safe and abstract view on the Web service. The following sections describe two ways of generating these proxies:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
  <li><a href="#wsimport">Using the JDK tool <tt>wsimport</tt>. (We recommend this alternative)</a></li>
  <li><a href="#jbosstools">Using tooling provided by Eclipse JBoss Tools.</a></li>
</ol>
<h2><a id="wsimport" name="wsimport"></a>A. <tt>wsimport</tt></h2>
<p>This procedure uses standardized JAX-WS technology (part of Java EE). It does, however, require more manual work than alternative B.&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
  <li>From the command line, execute "<small><tt>wsimport -keep &lt;URL of WSDL&gt;</tt></small>". This will generate Java source and class files.
  <ul>
    <li>Above command assumes that your PATH environment variable includes the "bin" folder from the JDK installation. If this is not the case, <a href="010_tutorial_jboss_setup.html">modify the environment variable</a> or use the full path to wsimport.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Import the generated source files into your Eclipse project: "File-&gt;Import" -&gt; "General &gt; File System"</li>
  <li>Depending on the Web service, several message and data classes will be generated. Furthermore, there will be a service class which inherits from javax.xml.ws.Service. Instantiate this class or, in a managed environment, use dependency injection with the annotation @WebServiceRef (see lecture). The service instance will offer a method that returns a proxy providing the Web service operation(s).</li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="jbosstools" name="jbosstools"></a>B. Eclipse JBoss Tools</h2>
<p>Proxies generated by this procedure use Apache Axis 1.4.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create the project that will access the web service, for example a plain Java project or an appropriate Java EE project.</li>
  <li>Right-click the project node in the "Project Explorer" and select "New -&gt; Other". Choose "Web Services &gt; Web Service Client" and press "Next".</li>
  <li>Enter the URL of the WSDL into the field "Service definition". Move the slider down to "Develop client". Finish the wizard.</li>
  <li>The wizard will import some JARs and create several Java classes. In order to access the Web service from your code, look for a class ending with "Proxy".</li>
</ol>
