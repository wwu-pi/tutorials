<p>This tutorial describes how to configure your systems to use them within a Message Oriented Middleware scenario that uses WildFly HornetQ as a JMS provider. With the following steps, it is possible to implement a .NET application that communicates with Java EE applications via JMS topics and/or queues. It can subscribe to topics, receive and send messages. The communication operates over the Stomp protocol. HornetQ, the standard JMS provider in WildFly Application Servers, can handle this protocol.</p>
<h2>Configure HornetQ</h2>
<p>To enable JMS in your WildFly server, the configuration file standalone.xml has to be modified. Changes can be found in the <a class="download" href="standalone.diff">diff file</a>. Add the lines that are marked with '+' at the beginning of the line to your configuration file. <br /> To provide a queue within the WildFly you can either specify them within the configuration file of the server, or by providing a file META-INF/hornetq-jms.xml within your EJB project. We recommend using the last method, as it is easier to handle within the group (see also <a class="download" href="binaries/JMS-Statistics.zip">JMS_Example</a>). </p>
<p>To provide a topic 'CustomerTopic' the file should contain the following:</p>
<pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;messaging-deployment xmlns="urn:jboss:messaging-deployment:1.0"&gt;
&lt;hornetq-server&gt;
&lt;jms-destinations&gt;
&lt;jms-topic name="CustomerTopic"&gt;
&lt;entry name="/topic/CustomerTopic" /&gt;
&lt;/jms-topic&gt;
&lt;/jms-destinations&gt;
&lt;/hornetq-server&gt;
&lt;/messaging-deployment&gt;</pre>
