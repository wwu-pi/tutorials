### GitHub for free

Enable your account to receive a free developer plan (with unlimited private repositories) on [github.com/edu](https://github.com/edu).
Before you request the free plan, ensure that you added your *uni-muenster.de* Email address to your GitHub account by [editing your profile](https://github.com/settings/emails) (it does not need to be the primary e-mail address).

### Usage

* [Introduction](http://try.github.com/)
* [Branching](http://pcottle.github.com/learnGitBranching/)
* [Pro Git Ebook](http://git-scm.com/book)

### Tools

**Beginners greatly benefit from using the command line interface**.
For day-to-day operations users employ various interfaces such as:

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
* [SourceTree for Windows+Mac](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)
* [SmartGit](http://freecode.com/projects/smartgit)

Or one of many [other graphical user interfaces](http://git-scm.com/downloads/guis).

Please note that additional tools might incur new errors. For example eGit (the Eclipse plugin) may introduce encoding errors in the code base when using guillemets (`<<`, french quotation marks) as used in the Xtend language.
